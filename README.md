# Sexual_antagonism

 In my masters I workdon sexual antagonism in Drosophila melanogaster. This involved selected lines of flies and comparing aspects of thier fitness.

 Unfortunately this was never published which I thought was odd given the time and effort put in by thers for the flies to be created.

 I still had the data and thought it best to share. Who knows if it is publishable one day.

I'll be making some efforst to make this cleaner and clearer to others but this will take sometime.
