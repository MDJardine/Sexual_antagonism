# Sexual_antagonism

 In my masters I workdon sexual antagonism in Drosophila melanogaster. This involved selected lines of flies and comapring aspects fo thier fitness.

 Unfortunately this was never published which I thought was odd given the time nd effort put in by thers for the flies to be created.

 I still had the data and thought it best to share. Who knows if it is publishable one day.
